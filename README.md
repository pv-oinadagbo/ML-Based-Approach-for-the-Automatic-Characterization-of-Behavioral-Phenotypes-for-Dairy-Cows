The United States is predicted to experience an annual decline in milk production due to 
heat stress of 1.4 and 1.9 kg/day by the 2050s and 2080s, with economic losses of $1.7 billion and $2.2 
billion, respectively, despite current cooling efforts implemented by the dairy industry. The ability 
of cattle to withstand heat (i.e., thermotolerance) can be influenced by physiological and behavioral 
factors, even though the factors contributing to thermoregulation are heritable, and cows vary in 
their behavioral repertoire. The current methods to gauge cow behaviors are lacking in precision 
and scalability. This paper presents an approach leveraging various Machine Learning (ML) (e.g., 
CNN and YOLOv8) and computer vision (e.g., Video Processing and Annotation) techniques aimed 
at quantifying key behavioral indicators, specifically drinking frequency and brush use- behaviors. 
These behaviors, while challenging to quantify using traditional methods, offer profound insights into 
the autonomic nervous system function and an individual cowâ€™s coping mechanisms under heat stress. 
The developed approach provides an opportunity to quantify these difficult-to-measure drinking and 
brush-use behaviors of dairy cows milked in a robotic milking system. This approach is expected to 
create a better opportunity for ranchers to make informed decisions that could mitigate the adverse 
effects of heat stress. It will also expedite data collection regarding dairy cow behavioral phenotypes. 
Finally, we evaluated our system using various performance metrics, such as classification accuracy. 
We found that the YoloV8 and CNN models achieved an overall average classification accuracy of 
93% and 96% for object detection and classification, respectively.
