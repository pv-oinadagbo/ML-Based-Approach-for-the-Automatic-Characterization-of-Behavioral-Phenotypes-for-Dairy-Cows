This app was developed as part of a research work to automatically detect and analyse behaviourial phenotypes in dairy cows. It analysies an uploaded video and does the following:
- Detect cows in the videos
- Assign ID to the cow(s) if there is a similarity between the cows in the videos and the ones already identified and saved in the database
- Tracks the behaviour and activities of the cows within the video frames
- Displays the drinking and brushing duration of the cows on a dashboard.
